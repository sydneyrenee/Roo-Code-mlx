## Refactoring Recommendations

### 1. Update Core Branding Module

- Ensure `src/core/branding.ts` includes all necessary branding elements
- Update `src/core/constants.ts` to provide accessor functions for all branding values

### 2. Refactor by Category

#### Extension ID
- Update all references to use `extensionId()` from constants

#### Command IDs
- Create a command ID generator function that prefixes commands with the branding prefix
- Update all command registrations to use this function

#### View IDs
- Create constants for view IDs that use the branding prefix
- Update all view registrations to use these constants

#### Configuration Keys
- Create a configuration key generator function
- Update all configuration access to use this function

#### Git Configuration
- Update all Git user name and email references to use branding constants
- Create functions for generating branch names with branding prefix

#### URLs and External Resources
- Add URL constants to the branding module
- Update all URL references to use these constants

#### Hardcoded Strings
- Replace all hardcoded branding strings with references to the branding module

#### Filenames
- Rename files to use generic names where possible
- For files that must include branding, generate names dynamically
