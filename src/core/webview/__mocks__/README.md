# ClineProvider Mock

This directory contains mock implementations of the ClineProvider and related classes for testing purposes.

## MockClineProvider

`MockClineProvider` is a testable implementation of the ClineProvider class that can be used in unit tests. It implements the same interface as the real ClineProvider but with simplified behavior and additional logging.

### Features

- Fully testable implementation with proper logging
- Returns predictable values for testing
- Implements the same interface as the real ClineProvider
- Includes logging via the logger utility

### Usage

```typescript
import { MockClineProvider } from '../../../../src/core/webview/__mocks__/ClineProvider.mock';

// Create mock context and output channel
const mockExtensionContext = { /* mock implementation */ } as vscode.ExtensionContext;
const mockOutputChannel = { /* mock implementation */ } as vscode.OutputChannel;

// Create instance of MockClineProvider
const clineProvider = new MockClineProvider(mockExtensionContext, mockOutputChannel);

// Use the mock in tests
const state = await clineProvider.getState();
await clineProvider.updateGlobalState('diffEnabled', false);
await clineProvider.clearTask();
```

## Testing Strategy

When testing components that depend on ClineProvider, use the MockClineProvider to:

1. Isolate the component under test
2. Control the behavior of the ClineProvider
3. Verify interactions with the ClineProvider

This approach allows for more reliable and faster tests that don't depend on the actual implementation details of ClineProvider.

## Maintenance

When the real ClineProvider is updated, make sure to update the MockClineProvider to maintain compatibility. The mock should implement the same public interface as the real implementation, but it doesn't need to replicate all the internal behavior.
