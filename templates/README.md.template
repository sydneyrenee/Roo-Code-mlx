**{{extension.displayName}}** is an AI-powered **autonomous coding agent** that lives in your editor. It can:

- Write and edit code based on natural language instructions
- Execute terminal commands and run tests
- Open browser sessions to test web applications
- Analyze and fix problems in your codebase

Whether you're seeking a flexible coding partner, a system architect, or specialized roles like a QA engineer or product manager, {{extension.displayName}} can help you build software more efficiently.

## What's New

This release brings significant improvements to how you interact with {{extension.displayName}}:

### Code Actions

{{extension.displayName}} now integrates directly with VS Code's native code actions system, providing quick fixes and refactoring options right in your editor. Look for the lightbulb ðŸ’¡ to access {{extension.displayName}}'s capabilities without switching context.

### Custom Modes

- **Custom File Restrictions**: In general, custom modes can now be restricted to specific file patterns (for example, a technical writer who can only edit markdown files ðŸ‘‹). There's no UI for this yet, but who needs that when you can just ask {{extension.displayName}} to set it up for you?

## Join Our Community

We've launched a new Discord community! Join us at [https://{{extension.name}}.com/discord](https://{{extension.name}}.com/discord) to:

- Get help and support
- Share your projects and ideas
- Connect with other {{extension.displayName}} users

## Features

{{extension.displayName}} communicates in **natural language** and proposes actionsâ€”file edits, terminal commands, browser tests, etc. You choose how it behaves:

### Interaction Modes

- **Autonomous/Auto-Approve**: Grant {{extension.displayName}} the ability to run tasks without interruption, speeding up routine workflows.
- **Supervised**: Review and approve each action before execution, maintaining full control.

No matter your preference, you always have the final say on what {{extension.displayName}} does.

### Supported Models

Use {{extension.displayName}} with:

- **Claude** (Anthropic)
- **GPT-4** (OpenAI)
- **Usage Tracking**: {{extension.displayName}} monitors token and cost usage for each session.

### Custom Modes

**Custom Modes** let you shape {{extension.displayName}}'s persona, instructions, and permissions:

- **Built-in Roles**: Choose from Code, Architect, Ask, and other specialized modes
- **Customizable**: Tailor instructions and permissions for each mode
- **User-Created**: Type `Create a new mode for <X>` and {{extension.displayName}} generates a brand-new persona for that roleâ€”complete with tailored prompts and optional tool restrictions.

### Capabilities

{{extension.displayName}} can:

- **Write and Edit Code**: Create new files or modify existing ones
- **Analyze Code**: Understand complex codebases and explain how they work
- **Fix Bugs**: Identify and resolve issues in your code
- **Refactor**: Improve code structure and readability

### Terminal Integration

Easily run commands in your terminalâ€”{{extension.displayName}}:

- Executes build, test, and deployment commands
- Installs dependencies and tools
- Runs scripts and utilities
- Manages Git operations

You approve or decline each command, or set auto-approval for routine operations.

### Browser Integration

{{extension.displayName}} can also open a **browser** session to:

- Test web applications
- Verify UI changes
- Interact with web interfaces
- Capture screenshots for documentation

### MCP Integration

Extend {{extension.displayName}} with the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**:

- Add custom tools like web search, database access, or API clients
- Connect to external services and data sources
- Create specialized workflows for your projects

{{extension.displayName}} can build and configure new tools autonomously (with your approval) to expand its capabilities instantly.

### Context Providers

- **@file** â€“ Include specific files in the conversation
- **@folder** â€“ Add entire directories for context
- **@problems** â€“ Pull in workspace errors/warnings for {{extension.displayName}} to fix.
- **@git** â€“ Supply a list of Git commits or diffs for {{extension.displayName}} to analyze code history.

Help {{extension.displayName}} focus on the most relevant details without blowing the token budget.
