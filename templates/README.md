**My Extension** is an AI-powered **autonomous coding agent** that lives in your editor. It can:

- Write and edit code based on natural language instructions
- Execute terminal commands and run tests
- Open browser sessions to test web applications
- Analyze and fix problems in your codebase

Whether you're seeking a flexible coding partner, a system architect, or specialized roles like a QA engineer or product manager, My Extension can help you build software more efficiently.

## What's New

This release brings significant improvements to how you interact with My Extension:

### Code Actions

My Extension now integrates directly with VS Code's native code actions system, providing quick fixes and refactoring options right in your editor. Look for the lightbulb ðŸ’¡ to access My Extension's capabilities without switching context.

### Custom Modes

- **Custom File Restrictions**: In general, custom modes can now be restricted to specific file patterns (for example, a technical writer who can only edit markdown files ðŸ‘‹). There's no UI for this yet, but who needs that when you can just ask My Extension to set it up for you?

## Join Our Community

We've launched a new Discord community! Join us at [https://my-extension-name.com/discord](https://my-extension-name.com/discord) to:

- Get help and support
- Share your projects and ideas
- Connect with other My Extension users

## Features

My Extension communicates in **natural language** and proposes actionsâ€”file edits, terminal commands, browser tests, etc. You choose how it behaves:

### Interaction Modes

- **Autonomous/Auto-Approve**: Grant My Extension the ability to run tasks without interruption, speeding up routine workflows.
- **Supervised**: Review and approve each action before execution, maintaining full control.

No matter your preference, you always have the final say on what My Extension does.

### Supported Models

Use My Extension with:

- **Claude** (Anthropic)
- **GPT-4** (OpenAI)
- **Usage Tracking**: My Extension monitors token and cost usage for each session.

### Custom Modes

**Custom Modes** let you shape My Extension's persona, instructions, and permissions:

- **Built-in Roles**: Choose from Code, Architect, Ask, and other specialized modes
- **Customizable**: Tailor instructions and permissions for each mode
- **User-Created**: Type `Create a new mode for <X>` and My Extension generates a brand-new persona for that roleâ€”complete with tailored prompts and optional tool restrictions.

### Capabilities

My Extension can:

- **Write and Edit Code**: Create new files or modify existing ones
- **Analyze Code**: Understand complex codebases and explain how they work
- **Fix Bugs**: Identify and resolve issues in your code
- **Refactor**: Improve code structure and readability

### Terminal Integration

Easily run commands in your terminalâ€”My Extension:

- Executes build, test, and deployment commands
- Installs dependencies and tools
- Runs scripts and utilities
- Manages Git operations

You approve or decline each command, or set auto-approval for routine operations.

### Browser Integration

My Extension can also open a **browser** session to:

- Test web applications
- Verify UI changes
- Interact with web interfaces
- Capture screenshots for documentation

### MCP Integration

Extend My Extension with the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**:

- Add custom tools like web search, database access, or API clients
- Connect to external services and data sources
- Create specialized workflows for your projects

My Extension can build and configure new tools autonomously (with your approval) to expand its capabilities instantly.

### Context Providers

- **@file** â€“ Include specific files in the conversation
- **@folder** â€“ Add entire directories for context
- **@problems** â€“ Pull in workspace errors/warnings for My Extension to fix.
- **@git** â€“ Supply a list of Git commits or diffs for My Extension to analyze code history.

Help My Extension focus on the most relevant details without blowing the token budget.
