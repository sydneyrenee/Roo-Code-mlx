# Test Migration Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan for implementing the necessary changes to support the migration of tests from Jest to the VS Code Testing API.

## Background

The project currently has a mix of tests using Jest and the VS Code Testing API. The goal is to migrate all tests to the VS Code Testing API to take advantage of its richer test discovery, execution, and result reporting capabilities.

## Current Issues

1. **Documentation Issue**: The MIGRATION_STATUS.md document claims many tests have been migrated, but this doesn't match reality.
2. **Test Registration Issue**: Many tests that have been migrated to the VS Code Testing API format are not registered in the `registerTests.ts` file.
3. **Test Discovery Issue**: The VS Code Testing API uses a different approach to test discovery than Jest, which requires explicit registration of tests.

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Create Scripts for Test Migration

1. **Create find-unregistered-tests.js**:
   - Purpose: Find tests that have been migrated to the VS Code Testing API but are not registered
   - Implementation: Scan the project for test files, check if they use the VS Code Testing API format, and check if they are registered in `registerTests.ts`
   - Output: List of unregistered tests, import statements, and registration code to add to `registerTests.ts`

2. **Create generate-test-migration.js**:
   - Purpose: Generate a skeleton for migrating a Jest test file to the VS Code Testing API format
   - Implementation: Parse the Jest test file, extract test cases, and generate a new file with the VS Code Testing API format
   - Output: A new file with the same name as the original test file but with a `.migrated.ts` extension

3. **Create update-migration-status.js**:
   - Purpose: Update the migration status document with the current state of test migration
   - Implementation: Scan the project for test files, check their migration status, and update the `MIGRATION_STATUS.md` file
   - Output: Updated `MIGRATION_STATUS.md` file

### Step 2: Update Documentation

1. **Update MIGRATION_STATUS.md**:
   - Revise to accurately reflect which tests have been migrated and registered
   - Include a section on how to register tests
   - Include a section on how to migrate tests

2. **Create TEST_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md**:
   - Provide detailed instructions for migrating tests from Jest to the VS Code Testing API
   - Include examples and best practices
   - Reference the scripts created in Step 1

### Step 3: Register Migrated Tests

1. **Run find-unregistered-tests.js**:
   - Identify tests that have been migrated but not registered
   - Generate import statements and registration code

2. **Update registerTests.ts**:
   - Add import statements for unregistered tests
   - Add registration code for unregistered tests
   - Test and verify that all tests are running properly

### Step 4: Update MIGRATION_STATUS.md

Update the MIGRATION_STATUS.md document to accurately reflect the current state of test migration and registration.

## Success Criteria

1. All migrated tests are properly registered and running
2. Running `npm test` executes all registered tests
3. MIGRATION_STATUS.md accurately reflects the state of test migration and registration
4. A clear process is documented for registering new tests as they are migrated

## Implementation Steps

1. Create scripts for test migration
2. Update documentation
3. Register migrated tests
4. Update MIGRATION_STATUS.md to reflect the current state
5. Test and verify that all tests are running properly

## Timeline

1. Day 1: Create scripts for test migration
2. Day 2: Update documentation
3. Day 3: Register migrated tests and update MIGRATION_STATUS.md
4. Day 4: Test and verify that all tests are running properly

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Risk**: Some tests may not be compatible with the VS Code Testing API
   - **Mitigation**: Identify these tests early and create a plan for migrating them

2. **Risk**: The registration process may be error-prone
   - **Mitigation**: Create a script to automate the registration process

3. **Risk**: The migration status document may become outdated again
   - **Mitigation**: Create a script to automatically update the migration status document

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a clear path forward for migrating tests from Jest to the VS Code Testing API. By following this plan, we can ensure that all tests are properly migrated, registered, and running.
