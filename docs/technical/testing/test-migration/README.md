# Test Migration Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to the migration of tests from Jest to the VS Code Testing API.

## Current Status

- **Migration Progress**: 10.74% (16/149 tests migrated)
- **Working Tests**: 2.01% (3/149 tests registered and working)
- **Remaining Tests**: 89.26% (133/149 tests not yet migrated)

## Key Documents

- **[Implementation Summary](implementation-summary.md)**: Summary of changes implemented to support the test migration
- **[Implementation Plan](implementation-plan.md)**: Detailed plan for implementing the necessary changes
- **[Summary](summary.md)**: Overview of findings and recommendations

## Migration Scripts

The following scripts have been created to help with the migration process:

- `src/test/scripts/find-unregistered-tests.js`: Finds tests that have been migrated but not registered
- `src/test/scripts/generate-test-migration.js`: Generates a skeleton for migrating a Jest test file
- `src/test/scripts/run-tests.js`: Runs tests and provides a summary of the results
- `src/test/scripts/update-migration-status.js`: Updates the migration status document

## Next Steps

1. Register the 13 tests that have been migrated but are not registered
2. Continue migrating the remaining 97 tests that are still using Jest's describe/it pattern
3. Run tests incrementally to verify they work
4. Update documentation as tests are migrated and registered
